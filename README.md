This GitHub repository is meant to be the full documentation of the research involved for the paper mentioned above and additional material that maybe useful to continuing the work.  In the formal article, many details were omitted that I hope to fill in using this platform and make it easy for others learn from.   Below are the items "matching-with-chaos" is (tentatively) planned to have...

1. MATLAB simulation files (TODO)
2. TINA-TI SPICE Simulation files (TODO)
    Simulation 1 (Done) 12/05/2014
    Simulation 2 (Done) 12/07/2014
    Simulation 3 (TODO)
    Simulation 4 (TODO)
3. Experiment files including, schematics, data collection scripts, etc (TODO)
4. Demonstration simulation files for LTSPICE, NI Multisim, PSPICE (and when they don't work) (TODO)
5. Demonstration TINA-TI Simulation files for gyrator circuits to be used (copy-pasted) in other simulations. (TODO)
6. Details on the theory (MAYBE)

These files are only supplementary to the original paper. To make sense of it all the paper is very useful.

Paper Abstract:
In this paper, we develop a parameter matching technique using adaptive synchronization with a chaotic attractor. Two Chua's oscillators, identical in every parameter except for one, are set-up in a master/slave configuration where the slave's mismatched parameter is adaptable. Using Lyapunov functions and incorporating the presence of chaotic signals, adaptive control laws are designed to ensure exact parameter matching. One of the derived adaptive controllers is experimentally validated by using an adaptive inductor-gyrator composed of current feedback op-amps (CFOAs). The experimental results are compared to high-fidelity SPICE simulations, and performance of adaptive controllers are compared over a wide range of parameter values using MATLAB.
Keywords: Chua's oscillator; adaptive synchronization; parameter matching; inductor-gyrator; CFOA
